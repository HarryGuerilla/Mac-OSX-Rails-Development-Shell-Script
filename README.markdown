v.0.0.1 updated on 09/28/09

Synopsis
--------

This script hopes to make it easier to get your Mac setup with the proper tools to do 
Ruby on Rails and other web development work.

The script installs [Macports](http://www.macports.org/ "Macports") from source with 
which the necessary unix tools are installed to do Rails development. Macports offers the 
advantage of being able to install custom builds of unix tools without overriding the operating
system's defaults.

The script also installs [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ "Emacs") and sets it up to be used as a Rails IDE.

It has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.1 and is currently under development.
